# Js-Code-Quiz

## Description
This is my JS-Code-Quiz
This quiz is made up of three questions with three answer option if you click the wrong question times gets subtracted if you get it right points are logged and showed at the end.

## Installation
First I had to create a button that activated a countdown timer and function to start the game and within that new function there are elements being made and returning with the value of the array question title and choices each element (other than the question title) is making a button to keep track.
If a answer is then pressed it activates another function that function states that if the correct answer is not pressed than time will be deducted and a wrong message will show up. The question will then be rotated to the next appliqable question if there are no more question the quiz will then conclude to a new final page where you can submit your initials to save your score in local storage.
